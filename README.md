### What we did in this project3?
We could finish requirement 1-4.

We could not finish the requirement 5.

We were able to run everything up to requirement 4 without any errors.

We use test-input.txt to test our project.
test-output.txt is the result.

### Pair-programming
There is a lack of comments on each other's code. The reason was that we worked together in real time using Zoom during the project.
